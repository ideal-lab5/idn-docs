## IDN-Consumer

The IDN Consumer is a minimal 'consumer' parachain that is integrated with the IDN through both its [runtime](../parachains/runtime_integration/parachain_runtime_integration.md) (the idn-consumer-pallet) and through [ink! smart contracts](../parachains/smart_contracts/ink.md) (using the idn-client-contract-lib).
