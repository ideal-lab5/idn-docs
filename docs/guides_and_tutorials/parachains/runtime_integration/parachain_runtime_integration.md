# First Step to Parachain Integration: IDN Consumer Pallet

The **`pallet-idn-consumer`** provides a way for parachains to become a "consumer" of the Ideal Network (IDN). This pallet enables you to subscribe to randomness pulses, request subscription quotes, and manage your subscription state through XCM (Cross-Consensus Message Format).

This guide explains how to integrate the `pallet-idn-consumer` into your parachain's runtime. The core of the integration involves configuring the pallet and its dependencies to allow your parachain to interact with the Ideal Network (IDN) via XCM.

‚ûú Repository for [pallet-idn-consumer](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/idn-sdk/tree/main/pallets/idn-consumer).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This library has not yet been published.

## What's next?

After you have integrated the pallet in your runtime, learn about how to [create and manage](./subscription_mgmt.md) subscriptions.

---

## Key Features

* **Subscription Management**: Create, update, pause, reactivate, and terminate subscriptions.
* **Randomness Consumption**: Consume randomness pulses delivered by the IDN.
* **Quote Requests**: Request and consume quotes for subscription fees.
* **Subscription Info**: Retrieve and consume details about your subscriptions.
* **XCM Integration**: Interact seamlessly with the IDN Manager pallet on the Ideal Network.

---

## üìã Prerequisites
- The Target chain which manages the subscription should be a Sibling chain (share the same Relay Chain with IDN, but not be IDN)
- The Target chain has an RPC node exposed on PolkadotJS
- IDN and the Target chain should have a [bidirectional HRMP channel open](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5445/how-to-open-hrmp-channels-between-parachains )
- The Sibling chain‚Äôs sovereign account on IDN should have enough funds. See:
  - [How to calculate the sovereign account](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/a/1210/3994). TL;DR use [Shawn‚Äôs Para ID to account utility](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/), making sure to select ‚Äúsibling‚Äù in the dropdown

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can configure the pallet using the following runtime parameters:

* **`RuntimeEvent`**: The overarching event type for the runtime.
* **`PulseConsumer`**: An implementation of the `PulseConsumer` trait, which defines how to handle incoming randomness pulses.
* **`QuoteConsumer`**: An implementation of the `QuoteConsumer` trait, which defines how to handle incoming subscription quotes.
* **`SubInfoConsumer`**: An implementation of the `SubInfoConsumer` trait, which defines how to handle incoming subscription information.
* **`SiblingIdnLocation`**: The XCM location of the Ideal Network chain.
* **`IdnOrigin`**: The origin type to ensure that XCM calls are genuinely from the IDN.
* **`Xcm`**: The type that provides XCM APIs for cross-chain interactions.
* **`PalletId`**: A unique identifier for this pallet.
* **`ParaId`**: The parachain ID of your consumer chain.
* **`MaxIdnXcmFees`**: The maximum fee (in the IDN asset) to pay for executing a single XCM message sent to the IDN.
* **`WeightInfo`**: Weight functions for benchmarking.

### 0. Add the `pallet_idn_consumer` as a Dependency

Add the pallet to your cargo.toml with `default-features = false`:

``` shell
cargo add pallet-idn-consumer
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This library has not yet been published. Installation instructions are placeholders.
``` toml
pallet-idn-consumer = { version = "0.0.0", default-features = false }
```


### 1. The `pallet_idn_consumer::Config` Implementation

The first step is to implement the `Config` trait for your runtime. This defines how the pallet interacts with the rest of your parachain.

```rust
impl pallet_idn_consumer::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type PulseConsumer = PulseConsumerImpl;
    type QuoteConsumer = QuoteConsumerImpl;
    type SubInfoConsumer = SubInfoConsumerImpl;
    type SiblingIdnLocation = xcm_config::IdnLocation;
    #[cfg(not(feature = "runtime-benchmarks"))]
    type IdnOrigin = EnsureXcm<frame_support::traits::Equals<xcm_config::IdnLocation>>;
    #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
    type IdnOrigin = bench_ensure_origin::BenchEnsureOrigin;
    #[cfg(not(feature = "runtime-benchmarks"))]
    type Xcm = PolkadotXcm;
    #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
    type Xcm = ();
    type PalletId = IdnConsumerPalletId;
    type ParaId = IdnConsumerParaId;
    type MaxIdnXcmFees = MaxIdnXcmFees;
    type WeightInfo = IdnConsumerWeightInfo<Self>;
}
```

### 2. Custom Trait Implementations

The `pallet-idn-consumer` requires three custom trait implementations to define how your parachain processes incoming data from the IDN. You'll need to define the logic for these traits yourself.

  * **`PulseConsumer`**: This trait defines the logic for consuming randomness pulses delivered by the IDN.
  * **`QuoteConsumer`**: This trait handles subscription fee quotes.
  * **`SubInfoConsumer`**: This trait processes subscription information.

**Example Implementation:**

```rust

/// Dummy implementation of the ['PulseConsumer'] trait.
pub struct PulseConsumerImpl;
impl PulseConsumer<Pulse, SubscriptionId, (), ()> for PulseConsumerImpl {
	fn consume_pulse(pulse: Pulse, sub_id: SubscriptionId) -> Result<(), ()> {
		// Randomness consumption logic goes here.
		log::info!("IDN Consumer: Consuming pulse: {:?} with sub id: {:?}", pulse, sub_id);
		Ok(())
	}
}

/// Dummy implementation of the ['QuoteConsumer'] trait.
pub struct QuoteConsumerImpl;
impl QuoteConsumer<Quote, (), ()> for QuoteConsumerImpl {
	fn consume_quote(quote: Quote) -> Result<(), ()> {
		// Quote consumption logic goes here.
		log::info!("IDN Consumer: Consuming quote: {:?}", quote);
		Ok(())
	}
}

/// Dummy implementation of the ['SubInfoConsumer'] trait.
pub struct SubInfoConsumerImpl;
impl SubInfoConsumer<SubInfoResponse, (), ()> for SubInfoConsumerImpl {
	fn consume_sub_info(sub_info: SubInfoResponse) -> Result<(), ()> {
		// Subscription info consumption logic goes here.
		log::info!("IDN Consumer: Consuming subscription info: {:?}", sub_info);
		Ok(())
	}
}
```

### 3. Pallet and Parachain Configuration

The integration requires a few `parameter_types` macros to define constants.

  * **`IdnConsumerParaId`**: Your parachain's ID, fetched automatically from the `ParachainInfo` pallet.
  * **`IdnConsumerPalletId`**: A unique, fixed identifier for the `idn-consumer` pallet.
  * **`MaxIdnXcmFees`**: The maximum amount of fees your parachain is willing to pay in the IDN's native asset for an XCM message. This prevents a single message from consuming too many resources.

<!-- end list -->

```rust
parameter_types! {
    pub IdnConsumerParaId: ParaId = ParachainInfo::parachain_id();
    pub const IdnConsumerPalletId: PalletId = PalletId(*b"idn_cons");
    pub const MaxIdnXcmFees: u128 = 1_000_000_000_000;
}
```

-----

### 4. XCM Configuration

Correct XCM setup is vital for communication with the IDN.

  * **`SiblingIdnLocation`**: This parameter specifies the XCM location of the Ideal Network. You must define `xcm_config::IdnLocation` in your `xcm.rs` file. This tells your parachain where the IDN is located on the relay chain.
  * **`IdnOrigin`**: This parameter is a security measure that ensures incoming messages are from the correct source. It uses `EnsureXcm` to verify the sender's origin matches the defined `IdnLocation`. A separate mock origin is used for benchmarking.
  * **`Xcm`**: This specifies the XCM API your parachain uses. Typically, this will be `PolkadotXcm`, but it's configured to be a placeholder `()` for benchmarking to simplify the process.

<!-- end list -->

```rust
type SiblingIdnLocation = xcm_config::IdnLocation;

#[cfg(not(feature = "runtime-benchmarks"))]
type IdnOrigin = EnsureXcm<frame_support::traits::Equals<xcm_config::IdnLocation>>;

#[cfg(not(feature = "runtime-benchmarks"))]
type Xcm = PolkadotXcm;
```

### 5. Other Runtime Dependencies

Ensure your runtime includes the necessary dependencies, such as `ParachainInfo`, `Balances`, and the XCM-related pallets. The `WeightInfo` is also a standard parameter and should be generated via benchmarking for accurate extrinsic weights.
