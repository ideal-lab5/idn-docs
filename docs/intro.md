## Key Capabilities

### 🎲 Verifiable Randomness as a Service (VRaaS)
Tamper-proof, **publicly verifiable randomness** usable across chains via XCM or our SDK.  
Perfect for lotteries, leader election, shuffling, and more.

---

### ⏳ Timelock Encryption
Encrypt data **to the future**.  
Enable hidden bids, MEV resistance, sealed-bid auctions, and **time-based multiparty logic** without trust.

---

### 🌐 Built for Interoperability
Integrate Ideal Network with **minimal changes** to your chain.  
Coordinate randomness and time logic **trustlessly** across parachains and networks.
