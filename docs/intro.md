# Welcome to the Ideal Network

The Ideal Network is a decentralized entropy daemon for Web3: a trustless coordination layer providing randomness and time-based logic for cross-chain systems.

## Key Capabilities

### 🎲 Verifiable Randomness as a Service

Tamper-proof, publicly verifiable randomness usable across chains via XCM or SDK.

### ⏳ Timelock Encryption

Encrypt data to the future. Enable hidden bids, MEV resistance, and time-based multiparty logic.

### 🌐 Built for Interoperability

Chains can integrate IDN with minimal changes. Trustless coordination across parachains and networks.
