# Verifiable Randomness as a Service

The Ideal Network enables Verifiable-Randomness-as-a-Service (VRaaS), where the network manages subscriptions and dispatches pulses of verifiable randomness to subscribers. In the initial version, the IDN allows parachains and smart contracts to subscribe to randomness using XCM-based adapters. Subscriptions determine when and where randomness should be delivered, enabling fine-grained, automated, trustless, and on-chain randomness without manual intervention.

For parachain and smart contract developers, this unlocks a new capability, as they acquire randomness that is actionable, not just usable. Subscribed randomness can drive state changes, trigger smart contract logic, or gate access to critical operations, enabling provably fair games, lotteries, auctions, randomness-based governance, and many more protocols requiring fairness or covert coordination.

We offer an SDK and XCM adapter library to simplify integration with the IDN for both FRAME pallets and smart contracts. Developers can easily subscribe to and receive verifiable randomness from the comfort of their own runtime. Delivery via XCM follows finality of the IDN, and messages are trustlessly executed on the destination using standard cross-chain proof validation. No trust assumptions beyond finality and proof verification are required.
