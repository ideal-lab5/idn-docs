# Use Cases

The Ideal Network provides two core capabilities that solve critical problems across Web3:

1. **Verifiable Randomness as a Service (VRaaS)** - On-demand, subscribable randomness via XCM
2. **Timelock Encryption** - Cryptographically enforced temporal privacy for transactions and data

These primitives enable applications that are provably fair, MEV-resistant, and cryptographically coordinated without trust assumptions.

## What IDN Enables vs. Current Limitations

| **Problem Today** | **Without IDN** | **What IDN Enables** | **Example Use Cases** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MEV & Frontrunning**: Public mempools leak user intent | Transactions rely on miner honesty, complex private mempools, or sequencer trust | **Timelock-Enforced Confidentiality**: Transactions are hidden until execution | MEV-resistant swaps, sniping-proof liquidations |
| **Commit-Reveal Fragility**: Reveals can be delayed or withheld | Requires multi-step commit/reveal logic, off-chain coordination | **Simultaneous, Verifiable Reveals**: One-shot, non-interactive commitments | Sealed-bid auctions, zero-leak governance votes |
| **Lack of Privacy in Governance**: Votes are public before tally | Vote buying, coercion; partial zk or off-chain schemes | **Private, Timed Voting**: Ballots decrypted only at conclusion | DAO proposals, zk-governance mechanisms |
| **Unfair or Trust-Based Games**: Moves revealed or coordinated off-chain | Requires trusted server or player honesty | **Trustless Multiplayer Coordination**: Asynchronous, secret moves with fair reveal | Rock-paper-scissors, poker, prediction markets |
| **Bridging Requires Identity or Syncing**: Cross-chain coordination is brittle | Relayers, watchtowers, trusted bridges | **Covert Cross-Chain Actions**: Time-triggered messages with no off-chain coordination | Trustless swaps, composable IBC replacements |
| **No Native Timed Access**: Hard to enforce unlock schedules | Centralized timestamp servers, block-height hacks | **Time-Gated Smart Contracts**: Assets/actions unlocked cryptographically at a set time | Event ticketing, time-sensitive access, auto-publishing |
| **Key Custody & UX Bottlenecks**: Private key management is hard | Requires secure wallets, recovery schemes, seed phrases | **Keyless Protocols**: Timelocked recovery, one-time secrets, ambient access | Murmur wallet, time-released airdrops |
