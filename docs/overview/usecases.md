title: Use Cases
---

The Ideal Network provides two core capabilities that solve critical problems across Web3:

1. **Verifiable Randomness as a Service (VRaaS)** - On-demand, subscribable randomness via XCM
2. **Timelock Encryption** - Cryptographically enforced temporal privacy for transactions and data

These primitives enable applications that are provably fair, MEV-resistant, and cryptographically coordinated without trust assumptions.

## 🎮 Gaming & NFTs

### Use Case: Fair Loot Generation

**Problem:** Players can predict or manipulate loot drops using block-based randomness, leading to unfair advantages and economic exploitation.

**Solution:** VRaaS provides unpredictable randomness for loot generation that cannot be gamed.

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Subscribe to randomness for loot events
fn initialize_loot_system() {
    IDN::subscribe_randomness(
        frequency: Every(100), // Every 100 blocks
        callback: process_loot_drop
    );
}

fn process_loot_drop(randomness: [u8; 32]) {
    let rarity = calculate_rarity(randomness);
    let item = select_item_from_table(rarity, randomness);
    mint_loot_nft(player, item);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates bot exploitation
- Increases player trust
- Protects game economy
- Enables provably fair drops

**Example Projects:** RPG games, Battle Royales, MMORPGs, Dungeon Crawlers

### Use Case: NFT Trait Generation

**Problem:** NFT minting can be exploited when traits are predictable, allowing bots to snipe rare combinations.

**Solution:** VRaaS ensures truly random trait distribution during minting.

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn mint_nft(owner: AccountId) -> TokenId {
    let random = IDN::request_randomness().await;
    
    let traits = NftTraits {
        background: BACKGROUNDS[random[0] % BACKGROUNDS.len()],
        body: BODIES[random[1] % BODIES.len()],
        eyes: EYES[random[2] % EYES.len()],
        special: if random[3] % 100 < 5 { // 5% chance
            Some(RARE_TRAITS[random[4] % RARE_TRAITS.len()])
        } else { None }
    };
    
    create_nft(owner, traits)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Fair distribution of rare traits
- No sniping of specific combinations
- Transparent rarity mechanics
- Higher collection value

**Example Projects:** PFP Collections, Gaming NFTs, Generative Art, Dynamic NFTs

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn create_tournament_bracket(players: Vec<Player>) {
    let random = IDN::request_randomness().await;
    let shuffled = shuffle_players(players, random);
    generate_bracket(shuffled);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents collusion

---

### Use Case: Random Game Events

**Problem:** Predictable events (boss spawns, weather changes, bonus rounds) reduce gameplay excitement.

**Solution:** VRaaS triggers truly random events that surprise players.

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Subscribe to periodic randomness for events
IDN::subscribe_randomness(
    frequency: Every(50), // Check every 50 blocks
    callback: |random| {
        let event_roll = u32::from_bytes(random) % 1000;
        match event_roll {
            0..=5 => spawn_world_boss(),      // 0.6% chance
            6..=50 => trigger_bonus_event(),  // 4.5% chance
            51..=150 => weather_change(),     // 10% chance
            _ => {} // No event
        }
    }
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Genuine surprise and excitement
- No event prediction
- Dynamic gameplay
- Increased engagement

## 💰 DeFi & Financial Applications

### Use Case: Fair Liquidation Ordering

**Problem:** MEV bots manipulate liquidation order to extract value, leading to worse prices for users.

**Solution:** VRaaS randomizes liquidation order within each block, eliminating order-based MEV.

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn process_liquidations(candidates: Vec<Position>) {
    let random = IDN::request_randomness().await;
    
    // Randomly shuffle liquidation order
    let shuffled = shuffle_with_seed(candidates, random);
    
    for position in shuffled {
        if is_liquidatable(position) {
            liquidate(position);
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No liquidation front-running
- Fair opportunity for all liquidators
- Better prices for users
- Reduced MEV extraction

**Solution:** VRaaS provides verifiable random winner selection.

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn select_lottery_winner() -> AccountId {
    let participants = get_ticket_holders();
    let random = IDN::request_randomness().await;
    
    let winner_index = u32::from_bytes(random) % participants.len();
    let winner = participants[winner_index];
    
    distribute_prize(winner);
    emit_winner_event(winner, random); // Provide proof

### Use Case: Sealed-Bid Auctions (Timelock)

**Problem:** Public bids allow front-running and price manipulation in auctions.

**Solution:** Timelock encryption keeps bids secret until auction ends, then reveals all simultaneously.

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Bidder encrypts bid to future round
fn submit_sealed_bid(amount: Balance, auction_id: AuctionId) {
    let reveal_round = get_auction_end_round(auction_id);
    let encrypted_bid = IDN::timelock_encrypt(
        data: amount.encode(),
        round: reveal_round
    );
    
    store_encrypted_bid(auction_id, encrypted_bid);
}

// At auction end, all bids decrypt simultaneously
fn finalize_auction(auction_id: AuctionId) {
    let bids = get_encrypted_bids(auction_id);
    let decrypted = IDN::batch_decrypt(bids);
    
    let winner = find_highest_bidder(decrypted);
    transfer_item_to_winner(winner);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No bid front-running
- True price discovery
- Fair for all participants
- MEV-resistant

**Example Projects:** NFT marketplaces, Treasury auctions, Dutch auctions, Liquidation auctions

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn distribute_staking_rewards(total_rewards: Balance) {
    let stakers = get_all_stakers();
    let random = IDN::request_randomness().await;
    
    // Randomly select bonus reward recipients
    let bonus_recipients = select_random_subset(
        stakers, 
        count: 10, 
        seed: random
    );
    
    for recipient in bonus_recipients {
        send_bonus_reward(recipient);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No Sybil attack advantages
- Fair reward distribution

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn cast_vote(proposal_id: ProposalId, vote: Vote) {
    let voting_end = get_proposal_end_time(proposal_id);
    
    let encrypted_vote = IDN::timelock_encrypt(
        data: vote.encode(),
        unlock_time: voting_end
    );
    
    store_encrypted_vote(proposal_id, voter, encrypted_vote);
}

fn tally_votes(proposal_id: ProposalId) {
    require!(voting_ended(proposal_id));
    
    let encrypted_votes = get_all_votes(proposal_id);
    let decrypted = IDN::batch_decrypt(encrypted_votes);
    
    let result = count_votes(decrypted);
    execute_proposal_if_passed(result);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No vote manipulation
- Prevents bandwagon voting
- Eliminates vote buying
- True consensus discovery

**Example Projects:** DAO governance, Protocol upgrades, Treasury management, Community decisions

**Implementation:**
```rust
// All chains encrypt their actions to the same future time
fn initiate_cross_chain_swap() {
    let execution_time = current_time() + 3600; // 1 hour
    
    let action = SwapAction {
        chain: "Ethereum",
        amount: 100,
        token: "USDC"
    };
    
    let encrypted = IDN::timelock_encrypt(
        data: action.encode(),
        unlock_time: execution_time
    );
    
    broadcast_to_all_chains(encrypted);
}

// All chains execute simultaneously when time arrives
fn execute_cross_chain_actions() {
    let actions = get_pending_actions();
    let decrypted = IDN::batch_decrypt(actions);
    
    execute_all_atomically(decrypted);
}

```rust
fn schedule_announcement(
    content: String, 
    release_time: Timestamp
) {
    let encrypted = IDN::timelock_encrypt(
        data: content.encode(),
        unlock_time: release_time
    );
    
    store_scheduled_announcement(encrypted, release_time);
}

// Automatically becomes readable at release_time
fn get_announcement(id: AnnouncementId) -> Option<String> {
